#Neural Network

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability of the neural network to solve the problem of forecasting.
The temperatures of June month 2000 - 2011 was taken as a training set for predicting of the Neural Network.
The project simulates a radial base network. The Network education is held on the following algorithms: how to find the center and radius of functions by the method of K-averages, selection of network weights - one of the gradient algorithm (steepest descent or steepest descent to a torque) using Backpropagation.
